Emoji Tac Toe rebult for Swift UI

The (Emoji Tac Toe | http://www.pavley.com/emoji-tac-toe/) was originally written for UIKit. iOS 9.3. With iOS 13 and macOS 
Catalina 10.15 provides SwiftUI--a new declaritive way to build a crossplatform user experience that runs on both iOS and 
macOS. This repo represents my first attemp at recreating Emoji Tac Toe with Swift UI.

As this is a rewrite I've taken the opportunity to rethink my code from 2016. Or, maybe, I've gotten better at coding. Either
way Emoji Tac Toe 2.0 requires much less code than 1.0. I'm also supporting new features like Dark Mode, new Apple Emojis,
and (best of all), Catalyst (macOS app support).
